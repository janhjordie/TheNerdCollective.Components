Important Copilot Instruction

- Do not create new terminals. If an operation fails due to a port conflict or "address already in use" message, this indicates another terminal/process is already running and using the port.
- If you encounter such an error, do NOT attempt to spawn or kill processes yourself. Instead, immediately notify me with the exact error message so I can stop the existing process manually.
